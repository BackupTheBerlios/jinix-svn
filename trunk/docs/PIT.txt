=============
Programmable Interrupt Timer
=============
The PIT has 3 channels. The first channel, channel 0, is a timer. It is connected to the PIC,
so it generated "IRQ0".
The second, channel 1, is very old and on new systems not aviable.
The last, channel 2, is connected with the intern PC Speaker.

0x43 PIT Register
=============
Bits 7-6 - Select channel
		00 = Channel 0
		01 = Channel 1
		10 = Channel 2
		11 = Read-back command (8254 only)
Bits 5-4 - Access mode
		00 = Latch count value command
		01 = Access mode: lobyte only
		10 = Access mode: hibyte only
		11 = Access mode: lobyte/hibyte
Bits 3-1 - Aperating mode
		000 = Mode 0 (interrupt on terminal count)
		001 = Mode 1 (hardware re-triggerable one-shot)
		010 = Mode 2 (rate generator)
		011 = Mode 3 (square wave generator)
		100 = Mode 4 (software triggered strobe)
		101 = Mode 5 (hardware triggered strobe)
		110 = Mode 2 (rate generator)
		111 = Mode 3 (square wave generator)
Bit 0 - BCD/Binary mode
		0 = 16-bit binary
		1 = four-digit BCD
